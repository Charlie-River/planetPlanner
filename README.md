# planetPlanner
This is the aforementioned to-do list website (in my bio). It is the only non-university project that is in progress at the moment!

Tasks: 
- [x] Users can log in
- [x] Users can sign up
- [x] Users can add folders
- [x] Users can add tasks
- [x] Tasks from folders are displayed
- [x] Users can check tasks off once they're done - this affects the database.
- [x] Completed tasks that haven't been deleted will automatically be deleted after 7 days
- [x] Users can log out
- [x] Users can delete folders
- [x] Selecting a folder will change a heading (that needs to be implemented)
- [x] Users can delete tasks without them being completed
- [x] Only 1 form will appear at a time - because all forms appear in the same place
- [x] Completed tasks will look different on front-end
- [ ] Users can edit folders
 
+ Other tasks may be added further on
+ There might need to be a new page/nav that lets the user log out, edit folders/tasks, delete folders. This could be a users settings page, i dont want to clutter the main screen with too many things - hence thinking about a new page

### Other Information
There are a few style issues that I am fighting with at the moment, working on the functionality for the moment
  - This doesn't apply to the cute spaceman that I spent a while animating over the login page ðŸ˜¼

**Also!** This has not yet been optimized for mobile :( The mobile version will need a different page for showing tasks as there's not enough space to have it the same as it is on web.
