This is the aforementioned to-do list website (in my bio). It is the only non-university project that is in progress at the moment!

All main tasks were completed! The next steps are just some finalizing edits before I deem this complete ðŸ¤¯

Finalizing Tasks: 
- [ ] After editing a folder, the form needs manually closing before it refreshes the page
- [ ] Something should appear for the user when theyre not in a folder
- [ ] The heading which displays what folder the user is in, only changes if there are tasks in the folder
- [ ] After deleting a page, it removes the user from the folder theyt were in
- [x] Users should not be required to add a task description when adding a task
- [x] Alt needed for images


**Also!** This has not yet been optimized for mobile :( The mobile version will need a different page for showing tasks as there's not enough space to have it the same as it is on web.
